Not only are their weapons and armor top-grade, they also know how to use them to deadly effect. They are also completely resistant to electric, psionic and mental impairment thanks to their heavy augmentation. This paradox combat role is likely owed to the fact that ADVENT does not allow any clones to make executive decisions, even in specialized divisions such as the Bio one./n/nWhat makes the Bio General most threatening among all units encountered so far though is the fact that they can utilize their neural communicator to rapidly call in reinforcements, or much worse, orbital strikes. So far we have never had the time and infrastructure to investigate the current status of earth's satellite network, so the idea that ADVENT had deployed orbital strike satellites had in fact eluded us. Up until now. If Shen can manage to connect to one of these satellites and inject one of her master programs, we might be able to use it ourselves and gain a sizable advantage in the field.
