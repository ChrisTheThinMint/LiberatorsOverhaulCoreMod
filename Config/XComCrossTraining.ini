DefaultTrainingDaysWeapon = 8; 5 days to learn a new cross weapon trait

DefaultTrainingDaysExpert = 12; 10 days to learn Weapon Expert

DefaultTrainingDaysTrait = 9999; 15 days to learn a random positive trait. Does not change.

AdditionalWeaponDays = 4; we add two more days to all remaining traits for every cross weapon training. So if all we had left was Heavy Weapons Training, it would take 11 days to learn.

AdditionalExpertMultiplier = 1.25; once weapon expert is learned, we multiply trait training times by this number.
